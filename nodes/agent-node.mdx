## What is an Agent Node?

The **Agent Node** is an autonomous AI system that combines an LLM with tools to complete tasks iteratively. Unlike a simple LLM call, an Agent Node can:

- **Reason and plan** using large language models
- **Execute actions** through tool calling
- **Iterate autonomously** until the task is complete
- **Maintain context** across multiple tool calls
