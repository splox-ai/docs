## Conditional Edges

**Purpose:** Route execution based on switch node conditions

Conditional edges connect switch nodes to different target nodes based on evaluated conditions. Each branch (IF, ELIF, ELSE) has its own edge.

**In this example:**
- **Switch Node** has 4 output handles: IF, ELIF 1, ELSE, ERROR
- **IF branch** (dashed line) routes to **Template (3)**
- **ELIF 1 branch** (dashed line) routes to **Template (4)**
- **ELSE branch** (dashed line) routes to **Template (5)**
- Each condition evaluates in order, only one path executes
- Conditional edges shown with dashed lines and equals sign icons

**Branch Types:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="IF Branch">
    **First condition evaluated**
    
    - Primary condition check
    - Executes if condition is true
    - Can use AND/OR logic
    
    **Handle:** `if` or specific branch ID
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="ELIF Branches">
    **Additional conditions (evaluated in order)**
    
    - Checked if previous conditions failed
    - Support multiple ELIF branches
    - Each has unique branch ID
    
    **Handle:** `elif_1`, `elif_2`, etc.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="ELSE Branch">
    **Default fallback path**
    
    - Executes if no conditions matched
    - Always exists as fallback
    - No condition required
    
    **Handle:** `else`
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Multiple Outputs:**

Switch nodes can have many outgoing edges, one for each branch. The switch node evaluates conditions and routes execution to the matching edge.

**Visual Indicator:**
- Multiple output handles on the switch node
- Each handle labeled with branch type (IF/ELIF/ELSE)
- Only one path executes per switch
