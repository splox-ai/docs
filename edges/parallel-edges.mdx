## Parallel Edges (Default)

**Purpose:** Standard execution flow between nodes

Parallel edges are the default connection type. When a node completes, execution flows to all connected nodes simultaneously.

/>

**In this example:**
- The **Start Node** has one PARALLEL output handle
- Three **parallel edges** connect to three different Template nodes
- All three Template nodes execute **simultaneously** when Start completes
- Each Template receives a copy of the Start node's output data

**Characteristics:**
- **Concurrent Execution:** All target nodes run in parallel
- **No Waiting:** Each node starts as soon as its source completes
- **Data Cloning:** Source output is copied to all targets

**Use Cases:**
- Parallel API calls
- Multi-path workflows
- Fan-out patterns
- Independent processing streams
