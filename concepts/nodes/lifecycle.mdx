## Overview

Nodes go through various execution states as workflows run. Understanding these states helps you monitor and debug workflow execution.

## Execution States

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pending">
    Node is queued for execution but hasn't started yet
    
    **Visual:** Gray background
    
    **When it happens:**
    - Workflow just started
    - Waiting for previous nodes to complete
    - Queued in execution pipeline
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="In Progress">
    Node is currently executing
    
    **Visual:** Blue pulsing animation
    
    **When it happens:**
    - Node actively processing
    - LLM generating response
    - Tool executing action
    - Template rendering
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Completed">
    Node executed successfully
    
    **Visual:** Green background with checkmark
    
    **When it happens:**
    - Execution finished without errors
    - Output data available
    - Ready to trigger next nodes
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Failed">
    Node execution encountered an error
    
    **Visual:** Red background with error icon
    
    **When it happens:**
    - API errors or timeouts
    - Invalid configuration
    - Tool execution failures
    - Template syntax errors
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Waiting">
    Node is waiting for dependencies (parallel execution)
    
    **Visual:** Yellow background
    
    **When it happens:**
    - Waiting for parallel branches to complete
    - Merge node waiting for all inputs
    - Dependencies not yet satisfied
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Blocked">
    Node cannot execute due to missing dependencies
    
    **Visual:** Orange background
    
    **When it happens:**
    - Required input node didn't execute
    - Conditional branch not taken
    - Invalid workflow configuration
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Skipped">
    Node was skipped (conditional branching)
    
    **Visual:** Gray background with skip icon
    
    **When it happens:**
    - Switch node condition not met
    - Unselected conditional branch
    - Workflow path not taken
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Stopped">
    Workflow was stopped before reaching this node
    
    **Visual:** Dark gray background
    
    **When it happens:**
    - Manual workflow stop
    - Stop node triggered in subflow
    - Error in previous critical node
  </Step>
</Steps>
