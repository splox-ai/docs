## What is a Node?

A **node** is a single unit of execution within a workflow. Each node performs a specific action—calling an AI model, executing a tool, transforming data, or controlling execution flow. Nodes are connected by edges to create complex automation pipelines.

## Node Anatomy

### Handles

Nodes connect to each other through **handles** - connection points that define data flow:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Input Handles (Left Side)" icon="arrow-right">
    **Receive data and execution flow**
    
    - Located on the **left side** of nodes
    - Accept connections from previous nodes
    - Trigger node execution when activated
    - Pass data from source node to target node
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Output Handles (Right Side)" icon="arrow-right">
    **Send data to next nodes**
    
    Common output handle types:
    - **PARALLEL:** Main execution path (success)
    - **ERROR:** Error handling path (failures)
    - **TOOLS:** Tool calling path (LLM → Tool nodes)
    - **IF/ELIF/ELSE:** Conditional branching (Switch nodes)
    - **LOOP:** Iteration path (End → Start in subflows)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Special Handles" icon="sparkles">
    **Bottom/Top handles for specific purposes**
    
    - **MEMORY (bottom on LLM):** Bidirectional connection to Memory nodes
    - **MEMORY (top on Memory):** Connects to LLM's MEMORY handle
    - These handles enable persistent conversation context
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Node Configuration

Every node has configurable properties:

- **Name & Description:** Identify the node's purpose
- **Variable Mappings:** Reference data from previous nodes
- **Type-Specific Settings:** Model selection, tool configuration, conditions, etc.
- **Error Handling:** How the node responds to failures
