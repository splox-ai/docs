## Overview

Splox uses **pay-as-you-go pricing** with no upfront costs, subscriptions, or hidden fees. You only pay for what you use, when you use it.

<Card title="How Pricing Works" icon="sparkles">
  **Two simple pricing models:**
  
  1. **AI Models & Services** - Pay per usage (tokens, generations, seconds)
  2. **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)** - Fixed fee per API request (\$0.005)
  
  All pricing is transparent with real-time tracking in your dashboard.

## Billing & Usage

### How Billing Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pay-As-You-Go">
    No upfront costs or subscriptions. You only pay for what you use.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Real-Time Tracking">
    Monitor your usage and costs in real-time through the dashboard.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Usage Limits">
    Set spending limits to control costs and avoid unexpected charges.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Detailed Invoicing">
    Get itemized invoices with breakdowns by model, workflow, and date.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Token Counting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How are tokens counted?">
    Tokens are counted using the same tokenization as the model provider:
    - **GPT models:** ~4 characters = 1 token
    - **Claude models:** ~4 characters = 1 token
    - **Gemini models:** ~4 characters = 1 token
    
    Use our token calculator in the dashboard to estimate costs before running workflows.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What counts as input vs output?">
    - **Input tokens:** Your prompt + system messages + context + previous conversation
    - **Output tokens:** The model's generated response
    
    Output tokens are typically more expensive than input tokens.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does caching work?">
    Some models (Claude, GPT) support prompt caching:
    - **Cache Write:** First time sending repeated content (more expensive)
    - **Cache Read:** Subsequent uses of cached content (much cheaper)
    - **Cache TTL:** 5 minutes or 1 hour depending on model
    
    Caching can reduce costs by 90% for repeated prompts.
  </Accordion>
