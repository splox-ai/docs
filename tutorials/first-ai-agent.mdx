By the end of this AI agent tutorial, you'll have an autonomous agent that:
- Fetches real-time financial data automatically
- Analyzes trends using Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- Generates professional visualizations
- Works without any API keys or coding

**Example task:** "Analyze Bitcoin price trends over the last year and create a visualization"

**Time to complete:** 2 minutes  
**Skill level:** Beginner (no coding required)

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin building your AI agent, make sure you have:
- [ ] Splox account ([Sign up free](https://app.splox.io))

That's it. Splox handles API keys, infrastructure, and tool orchestration automatically.

---

## Step 1: Choose the DevOps Agent Template

1. Navigate to the [Templates page](https://app.splox.io/templates)
2. Find and click the **DevOps Agent** card (under Development category)
3. On the template details page, click **Use Template**

The workflow canvas will open automatically with your new AI agent ready to use.

**What's happening:** Splox creates a pre-configured autonomous agent with all the tools needed for data analysis, file management, and code execution.

## Step 2: Activate Chat Mode

In the bottom toolbar, click the **chat bubble icon** (5th icon from left).

A chat panel will slide in from the right side of the screen.

**What's happening:** Chat Mode lets you interact with your AI agent using natural language - no need to configure nodes or write code.

---

## Step 3: Give Your AI Agent a Task

In the chat input field at the bottom, type:

```
Analyze Bitcoin price trends over the last year and create a visualization
```

Press **Enter** to send.

**What's happening:** The autonomous AI agent will automatically:
1. Fetch Bitcoin price data from a public source
2. Use Python (pandas/matplotlib) to analyze the data
3. Generate a professional chart
4. Save it as an image you can download

---

## Step 4: Watch Your AI Agent Work Autonomously

Your AI agent will immediately start working on the task. You'll see:

- **Real-time tool usage** in the chat (e.g., "Fetching data...", "Running Python analysis...")
- **Active nodes lighting up** on the workflow canvas (left side)
- **Progress updates** as the agent uses different tools

The analysis typically takes 1-2 minutes.

**What's happening:** The agent autonomously:
1. Searches for reliable Bitcoin price data sources
2. Fetches historical price data
3. Writes and executes Python code (pandas, matplotlib)
4. Generates a professional multi-chart visualization
5. Saves and shares the result

---

## Step 5: Review Your AI-Generated Analysis

Once complete, the agent will respond with:

- **Detailed analysis** of Bitcoin price trends
- **Key insights** highlighting important patterns
- **Professional visualization** embedded in the chat
- **Downloadable file** (click the filename to save)

You can also see the Python code used by expanding the code blocks in the response.
