---

In this tutorial you'll build a fully working AI agent from scratch using the Splox workflow builder. No templates, no shortcuts — just three nodes wired together.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have an autonomous agent that:
- Receives a user message via the **Start** node
- Thinks and decides what to do via the **Agent** node
- Takes real actions using a connected **Tool** node

**Time to complete:** 5 minutes  
**Skill level:** Beginner

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- [ ] A [Splox account](https://app.splox.io)

---

## Step 1: Create a New Workflow

1. Go to [app.splox.io](https://app.splox.io) and open the **Workflows** section
2. Click the **+** button on the left panel
3. Give it a name — e.g. `My First Agent`
4. The workflow canvas opens with an empty graph

---

## Step 2: Add a Start Node

The Start node is the entry point of your workflow.

1. Right-click on the canvas → **Start**

<Note>Every workflow needs exactly one Start node. It has no configuration — it simply marks where execution begins.</Note>

---

## Step 3: Add an Agent Node

The Agent node is an LLM that reads the input, reasons about it, and decides whether to call a tool or respond directly.

1. Right-click on the canvas → **Agent**
2. In the config panel:
   - **Model** — pick any model (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-5` or `gpt-4o`)
   - **System Prompt** — write a short instruction, e.g.:

```
You are a helpful assistant. Use available tools when needed to answer the user's question.
```

3. Click **Save**

---

## Step 4: Add a Tool Node

The Tool node gives your agent access to the **Tool Router** — a smart layer that automatically finds the right tool from the MCP marketplace based on what the agent needs to do.

1. Right-click on the canvas → **Tool**

That's it. The Tool Router handles the rest: when your agent runs and needs a capability (e.g. web search, sending a message), it will find the matching tool from your connected MCP integrations. If you don't have the required connection yet, the agent will surface a link to connect it from the MCP marketplace.

## Step 5: Connect Everything

Now wire the nodes together:

1. **Start → Agent**: drag from the Start node's output handle to the Agent node's input handle
2. **Agent → Tool**: drag from the Agent node's **TOOLS** handle to the Tool node's input handle

<Note>Make sure you connect from the **TOOLS** handle (not the PARALLEL handle) on the Agent node. This enables the tool-calling loop so results return back to the Agent.</Note>

## Step 6: Run It

1. Click **Save** in the top toolbar
2. Open the **Chat** panel (bottom toolbar → chat icon)
3. Type a message, e.g. `Search the web for the latest AI news`
4. Hit **Enter** — your agent will call the tool, get the result, and respond

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why does the Tool connect back to the Agent?">
    When an LLM calls a tool, it needs to receive the result back to continue reasoning. The TOOLS edge creates this loop — the Agent calls the Tool, gets the result, and then decides what to do next (call another tool or respond to the user).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I add more tools?">
    Yes. Add more Tool nodes and connect them all to the Agent's TOOLS handle. The agent will automatically know about all connected tools and choose the right one based on context.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between TOOLS and PARALLEL handles?">
    The **TOOLS** handle is used for tool-calling loops — results return to the Agent. The **PARALLEL** handle is for regular sequential flow where the Agent's output passes to the next node without looping back.
  </Accordion>

## Next Steps

- **Memory** — the Agent node is always multi-turn by default. Open the node config to tune memory settings: limit type (messages or tokens), max messages/tokens, trim strategy, summarization, and more.
- **Add more tools** — connect multiple Tool nodes to give your agent more capabilities
- **Go parallel** — check out [Parallel Agents](/tutorials/parallel-agents) to run multiple agents simultaneously
- **Build multi-agent systems** — explore [Multi-Agent Teams](/tutorials/multi-agent-team)
- **Join the community** — share your builds at [community.splox.io](https://community.splox.io) or [Telegram](https://t.me/splox_ai)
