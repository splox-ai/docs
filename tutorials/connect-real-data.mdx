- Analyzes sentiment (positive, negative, neutral)
- Extracts key themes and issues
- Creates organized insights in Notion
- Alerts your team in Slack about critical feedback

**Example task:** "Analyze the customer reviews in my Google Sheet, categorize them by sentiment, create a summary in Notion, and post critical issues to Slack"

**Time to complete:** 10 minutes  
**Skill level:** Beginner

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- [ ] Splox account ([Sign up free](https://app.splox.io))
- [ ] Google account (for Google Sheets)
- [ ] Slack workspace with admin access
- [ ] Notion account

---

## Step 1: Create Your Workflow

Let's start by creating your workflow from the DevOps Agent template.

1. Navigate to the [DevOps Agent template](https://app.splox.io/templates/01987643-c8fb-73bc-9da5-b28908134155)
2. Click **Use Template** to create your workflow
3. The workflow canvas will open with your new agent ready to configure

<img src="https://splox-app.s3.amazonaws.com/019a8d3d-66f2-739a-b4e8-55143594e750.png" alt="DevOps Agent template in Splox" style={{ borderRadius: '12px' }} />

**What's happening:** You're creating a pre-configured AI agent that can use tools, remember context, and perform complex tasks autonomously.

---

## Step 2: Connect Google Workspace

Now let's connect your Google account to Splox.

1. Go to [Integrations](https://app.splox.io/integrations?tab=browse)
2. Click on **Google Workspace**
3. Enter an Integration Label (e.g., "My Google Account")
4. Make sure **Is Active** is toggled on
5. Click **Connect**
6. Sign in with your Google account and authorize access

<img src="https://splox-app.s3.amazonaws.com/019abc1c-e8c8-7814-bcd4-195918f02358.png" alt="Google Workspace integration setup in Splox" style={{ borderRadius: '12px' }} />

**What's happening:** Splox uses OAuth to securely connect to your Google account. Your credentials are never stored - only an access token that can be revoked anytime.

---

## Step 3: Connect Slack

To send alerts to Slack, you'll need to create a Slack app and get your Bot Token.

### Create a Slack App

1. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Click **Create New App** → **From scratch**
3. Name your app (e.g., "Splox Feedback Bot")
4. Select your workspace
5. Click **Create App**

### Get Your Bot Token

1. In the left sidebar, click **OAuth & Permissions**
2. Scroll to **Scopes** → **Bot Token Scopes**
3. Add these scopes:
   - `chat:write` - Send messages
   - `channels:read` - View channels
4. Scroll up and click **Install to Workspace**
5. Authorize the app
6. Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (starts with `xoxb-`)

### Connect to Splox

1. Go to [Splox Integrations](https://app.splox.io/integrations/new?platform_id=slack)
2. Enter an Integration Label (e.g., "Slack Workspace")
3. Paste your **Bot Token**
4. For **Verify Token**, enter any string (e.g., "splox123") - this is for webhook verification
5. Click **Connect**

<img src="https://splox-app.s3.amazonaws.com/019abc1d-365f-7814-83d1-3263b7ee7221.png" alt="Slack integration setup with Bot Token" style={{ borderRadius: '12px' }} />

<Tip>
  Don't forget to invite your Slack bot to the channel where you want alerts! Type `/invite @YourBotName` in the channel.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Connect Notion via MCP

Notion uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for integration. This requires a slightly different setup.

1. Navigate to the [DevOps Agent template](https://app.splox.io/templates/01987643-c8fb-73bc-9da5-b28908134155)
2. Click **Use Template** to create your workflow
3. Right-click on the canvas and select **Tool** to add a new Tool Node
4. Configure the Tool Node:
   - **Node Label:** `Notion`
   - **Tool Type:** `MCP`
   - **Launch Method:** `Remote`
   - **Transport Type:** `Streamable HTTP`
   - **MCP URL:** `https://mcp.notion.com/mcp`
   - **Output Storage:** `Memory`
5. Click the **Connect** button next to MCP URL
6. A Notion popup will appear - authorize access to your workspace
7. Check **"I recognize and trust this URL"** and click **Continue**

<img src="https://splox-app.s3.amazonaws.com/019abc23-c6bf-7814-927b-8e0e86298911.png" alt="Notion MCP Tool Node configuration with OAuth popup" style={{ borderRadius: '12px' }} />

**What's happening:** MCP (Model Context Protocol) allows AI agents to securely interact with external services. Notion's MCP server handles authentication and provides tools for reading/writing pages and databases.

---

## Step 5: Build the Workflow

Now let's add Tool Nodes for Google Sheets and Slack, then connect everything to the AI agent.

### Add Google Sheets Tool Node

1. Right-click on the canvas → select **Tool**
2. Configure:
   - **Node Label:** `Google Spreadsheet`
   - **Tool Type:** `Operations`
   - **Platform:** `Google Workspace`
   - **Integration:** Select your connected Google integration
   - **Operations:** Select the spreadsheet operations you need (read, write)
3. Connect this node to the **TOOLS** output handle on the DevOps LLM node

### Add Slack Tool Node

1. Right-click on the canvas → select **Tool**
2. Configure:
   - **Node Label:** `Slack`
   - **Tool Type:** `Operations`
   - **Platform:** `Slack`
   - **Integration:** Select your connected Slack integration
   - **Operations:** Select messaging operations (send message)
3. Connect this node to the **TOOLS** output handle on the DevOps LLM node

### Connect Notion Tool Node

1. Find the Notion Tool Node you created in Step 4
2. Connect it to the **TOOLS** output handle on the DevOps LLM node

Your workflow should now look like this:

<img src="https://splox.s3.amazonaws.com/019ac9c1-5a7b-7993-a8af-90209b5a82db.png" alt="Complete workflow with Google Sheets, Notion, and Slack Tool Nodes connected to DevOps LLM" style={{ borderRadius: '12px' }} />

<Info>
  **One Tool Node = One Platform.** Each integration platform needs its own Tool Node. The AI agent will automatically choose which tools to use based on your request.
</Info>

## Step 6: Run the Analysis

Time to see your AI agent in action!

We've prepared a sample Google Sheet with 136 real Amazon food reviews for you to analyze:

📊 **[Sample Customer Reviews Dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pa-qk7zNywzO_rq48haS-_1JX0X6m6UQSLWxWp4I0To/edit?gid=2213027#gid=2213027)**

1. Click the **chat bubble icon** in the bottom toolbar to open Chat Mode
2. Type your analysis request:

```
Analyze the customer reviews in this Google Sheet:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pa-qk7zNywzO_rq48haS-_1JX0X6m6UQSLWxWp4I0To/edit?gid=2213027#gid=2213027

For each review:
- Categorize sentiment (positive, negative, neutral)
- Extract key themes (product quality, taste, value, shipping)
- Identify critical issues that need immediate attention

Then:
1. Create a Notion page with a summary of findings and a table of categorized reviews
2. Post a message to #customer-feedback in Slack with any critical issues (1-star reviews or urgent complaints)
```

3. Press **Enter** and watch the AI work across all three platforms!

<img src="https://splox-app.s3.amazonaws.com/019abc1e-fb24-7814-a7e7-c4bfc78dd800.png" alt="Chat Mode with customer feedback analysis prompt" style={{ borderRadius: '12px' }} />

<Tip>
  **Want to use your own data?** Simply replace the Google Sheet URL with your own spreadsheet. The AI agent will adapt to whatever columns and data structure you have.
</Tip>

---

## Step 7: Review the Results

Your AI agent will:

1. **Read** all reviews from your Google Sheet
2. **Analyze** each review for sentiment and themes
3. **Create** a Notion page with:
   - Executive summary
   - Sentiment breakdown (X positive, Y negative, Z neutral)
   - Common themes identified
   - Table of all reviews with categories
4. **Alert** your Slack channel about critical issues
