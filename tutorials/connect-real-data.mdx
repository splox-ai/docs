title: "Connect AI to Your Data Sources"
description: "Learn how to connect external services, APIs, and data sources to your Splox agents using MCP (Model Context Protocol)."
---

Out of the box, your agent can reason and respond — but to take real actions in the world, it needs to connect to external services. In Splox, this is done through **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: a universal standard for plugging any API, database, or service into your AI agent.

## What Is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard that defines how AI agents communicate with external tools and services. Think of it as a universal adapter — any service that speaks MCP can be plugged into any MCP-compatible agent.

In Splox, every external integration (Telegram, Slack, GitHub, databases, custom APIs) is an MCP server. When you connect one, your agent gains the ability to call its tools — send messages, query data, trigger actions — all through a single standardized interface.

<Note>You don't need to understand the MCP protocol itself. Splox handles everything — you just connect and use.</Note>

---

## Step 1: Open the MCP Marketplace

1. Go to [app.splox.io](https://app.splox.io)
2. Click **Tools** in the left sidebar
3. Browse or search for the service you want to connect (e.g. Telegram, Slack, Serper)

---

## Step 2: Connect a Service

1. Click on a service in the marketplace
2. Enter the required credentials (API key, token, etc.)
3. Splox validates the connection live — if it works, it's saved

Your connection is now stored securely (AES-encrypted) and available to any workflow you build.

<Note>Different services require different credentials — an API key, a bot token, or OAuth login. The marketplace shows exactly what's needed for each one.</Note>

## Step 3: Add a Tool Node to Your Workflow

Once connected, add a **Tool** node to your workflow and connect it to your Agent:

1. Right-click on the canvas → **Tool**
2. Connect the Agent's **TOOLS** handle to the Tool node

That's it. The **Tool Router** automatically discovers all your connected MCP servers and their tools. When your agent needs to take an action, it searches your connections, finds the right tool, and calls it.

---

## Step 4: Run It

1. Open the **Chat** panel
2. Ask your agent to do something that uses the connected service — e.g. `Send a message to my Telegram channel saying hello`
3. The agent will find the right tool, call it, and report back

## Advanced: End-User Connections

If you're building a product for others, your end-users can connect **their own accounts** at runtime — without ever touching Splox.

When an agent needs a tool the user hasn't connected yet, the Tool Router generates a **secure connect link** and surfaces it in the chat. The user clicks it, enters their credentials, and the agent continues — all without leaving the conversation.

This works automatically — no extra configuration needed.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I connect multiple services at once?">
    Yes. Connect as many MCP servers as you like. Add multiple Tool nodes to your workflow — one per service, or use a single Tool node and let the Tool Router discover all connections automatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is my data secure?">
    Yes. All credentials are AES-encrypted at rest and never exposed to the agent or LLM. The agent only sees the tool names and their schemas — not your API keys.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I connect my own custom API?">
    Yes. Any service that implements the MCP protocol can be connected. You can also self-host an MCP server and connect it via its URL in the Tools section.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if a tool isn't in the marketplace?">
    You can connect any MCP-compatible server directly by entering its URL in the Tools section — it doesn't need to be listed in the marketplace.
  </Accordion>
