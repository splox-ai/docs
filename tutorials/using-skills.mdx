title: "Supercharge Agents with Skills"
description: "Skills are reusable instruction packages that give your agents specialized capabilities. Fork from the catalog or build your own."

Skills are folders of instructions and reference files that teach your agent how to handle specific tasks — consistently, without repeating yourself in every system prompt. Attach a skill to an agent node and it instantly gains that expertise.

## Part 1: Use a Skill from the Catalog

The fastest way to get started is to fork a published skill. For example, **Telegram Bot Creator** automates Telegram bot creation and deployment to Digital Ocean or Hetzner Cloud using `python-telegram-bot` + Docker Compose — supports workflow bots, inline bots with Telegram Stars payments, and Mini App bots.

### Step 1: Find and Fork the Skill

1. Go to [app.splox.io](https://app.splox.io) and click **Skills** in the left sidebar
2. Switch to the **Catalog** tab and search for `telegram-bot-creator`
3. Click **Fork** — Splox creates an independent copy in your library

### Step 2: Attach to Your Agent

1. Open your workflow and click the **Agent** node
2. In the config panel under the **Model** tab, find the **Skills** field
3. Select your forked skill from the dropdown

### Step 3: Run It

Open the **Chat** panel and ask your agent to create a Telegram bot. The agent reads the skill's instructions on demand and follows the deployment steps automatically.

<Note>You can fork any published skill and customize the files freely. Your copy is fully independent.</Note>

## Part 2: Create Your Own Skill

### Skill Structure

A skill is a folder of files following a simple convention:

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md          # Main instructions (required)
├── references/       # Deep reference docs (loaded on demand)
└── scripts/          # Executable code (optional)
```

The agent loads content in layers: it always reads the YAML frontmatter, loads `SKILL.md` when the skill is relevant, and navigates into `references/` only when it needs deeper context. This keeps token usage lean.

### SKILL.md Format

The frontmatter is the most important part — it's how the agent decides when to use the skill:

```markdown
---
name: brand-voice
description: Writes content in our company tone of voice. Use when user asks
  to write announcements, emails, blog posts, or any public-facing copy.
---

## Instructions

1. Always use an active, direct voice
2. Keep sentences under 20 words
3. Avoid jargon — write for a general audience
...
```

<Note>The `description` field drives triggering. Include **what the skill does** and **when to use it** (trigger phrases). See [Anthropic's guide](https://resources.anthropic.com/hubfs/The-Complete-Guide-to-Building-Skill-for-Claude.pdf) for best practices.</Note>

### Step 1: Create the Skill

1. Click **Skills** in the left sidebar
2. Click **New Skill**
3. Enter a name (kebab-case, e.g. `brand-voice`) and description
4. Click **Create**

### Step 2: Add Files

1. Open your new skill and create a `SKILL.md` file
2. Add the YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`
3. Write your instructions below the frontmatter
4. Optionally add files under `references/` for deep reference content

### Step 3: Attach and Test

Attach the skill to an agent node (Skills field in the Model tab), open Chat, and ask something that should trigger it. You can debug triggering by asking the agent directly: *"When would you use the brand-voice skill?"*

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does the agent know when to use a skill?">
    The agent reads the `description` field in `SKILL.md`'s YAML frontmatter. It uses this to decide whether the skill is relevant to the current task. Write descriptions that include specific trigger phrases, not just a general description.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I attach multiple skills to one agent?">
    Yes. The agent sees all attached skills and can use any combination of them within a single conversation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I update a skill without changing my workflows?">
    Yes. Workflows reference skills by ID. Update the skill files and all agents using it pick up the changes immediately on the next run.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I share my skill with others?">
    Yes. Open the skill settings and click **Publish** to add it to the public catalog. Others can then fork it into their own library.
