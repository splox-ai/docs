title: "Supercharge Agents with Skills"
description: "Learn how to create reusable Skills — knowledge bundles of files and instructions that give your agents specialized capabilities."

Skills are reusable packages of files, instructions, and reference material that you attach to any agent. Instead of repeating the same context in every system prompt, you build a Skill once and reuse it across workflows.

## What You'll Build

A Skill that gives your agent specialized knowledge — for example, your company's tone-of-voice guide, an API reference, or a coding playbook — and attach it to an agent node.

## What Is a Skill?

A Skill is a named bundle of files stored in the cloud. When attached to an agent, the agent becomes aware of the skill's name and description. During a conversation, the agent can read any file from the skill on demand — a guide, a reference doc, a script, anything.

Think of it like giving your agent a bookshelf. It knows what books are there, and it can open any of them when it needs to.

## Step 1: Create a Skill

1. Go to [app.splox.io](https://app.splox.io) and click **Skills** in the left sidebar
2. Click **New Skill**
3. Give it a name (e.g. `brand-voice`) and a description (e.g. `Our company's tone of voice and writing guidelines`)
4. Click **Create**

## Step 2: Add Files to Your Skill

A skill can contain any files — markdown guides, code snippets, JSON data, API references, playbooks.

1. Open your new skill
2. Upload or create files (e.g. `SKILL.md` with your instructions, `guide.md` with reference content)
3. The agent will be able to read these files at runtime

<Note>Convention: add a `SKILL.md` file at the root with a description of what the skill does and how the agent should use it.</Note>

---

## Step 3: Attach the Skill to an Agent Node

1. Open your workflow and click the **Agent** node
2. In the config panel, find the **Skills** field under the **Model** tab
3. Select your skill from the dropdown
4. The skill's name and description are now injected into the agent's context automatically

---

## Step 4: Run It

1. Open the **Chat** panel
2. Ask something that requires the skill's knowledge — e.g. `Write a product announcement in our brand voice`
3. The agent reads the skill files on demand and responds with the right context

## Advanced: Skills Catalog

You can publish a skill to the **public catalog** so other Splox users can discover and fork it into their own library. Published skills can be browsed and added with one click — Splox creates an independent copy in the user's account.

You can also fork skills from the catalog into your own library and customize them freely.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does the agent know what's in the skill?">
    The skill's name and description are appended to the agent's system prompt automatically. The agent then calls `skills_read_file` or `skills_list_directory` tools at runtime to read specific files when needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I attach multiple skills to one agent?">
    Yes. Select as many skills as needed in the agent config. The agent sees all of them and can read from any one.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What file types can I add?">
    Any file type — markdown, plain text, JSON, code files, CSV. The agent reads them as text content.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I update a skill without changing my workflows?">
    Yes. Workflows reference the skill by ID. Update the skill's files and all agents using it will get the new content automatically on the next run.
  </Accordion>
