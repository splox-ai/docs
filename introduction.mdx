## What is Splox?

Splox is a **visual workflow automation platform** where AI agents work together like a team. Build complex automations by connecting nodes - no coding required, but powerful enough for developers.

## How it Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Design Your Workflow">
    Drag and drop nodes onto the canvas. Each node is a step: call an AI agent, run code, fetch data, or trigger an integration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect the Pieces">
    Draw edges between nodes to define the flow. Add conditional logic, loops, and parallel execution.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy & Monitor">
    Run workflows manually, on a schedule, or trigger them via webhooks. Watch execution in real-time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Real Example: Customer Support Automation

Here's a workflow that handles support tickets automatically:

**What happens:**
1. **Webhook receives** new support ticket
2. **AI agent classifies** urgency and topic
3. **If urgent** → Slack alert + Jira ticket
4. **If normal** → AI generates response, sends email
5. **Everything logged** to your database

**Before:** 20 minutes per ticket (manual)  
**After:** 30 seconds (fully automated)

## Why Choose Splox?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Multi-Agent AI Orchestration" icon="brain">
    Unlike traditional tools, Splox lets multiple AI agents collaborate. One agent gathers data, another analyzes it, a third makes decisions - all in one workflow.
    
    **Example:** Content pipeline where one agent researches, another writes, and a third edits.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Code + No-Code Hybrid" icon="code">
    Visual editor for simplicity. But when you need custom logic, drop into Python or JavaScript - no servers to manage.
    
    **Example:** Simple automations stay visual, complex data transformations use code.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="500+ Tool Connections" icon="plug">
    Not just API calls - full OAuth flows, dynamic forms, webhooks, and real-time triggers. Connect to Slack, Google, Salesforce, databases, and more.
    
    **Example:** Pull data from Airtable, process with AI, push to Salesforce - all native.
  </Accordion>


  <Accordion title="Persistent Memory" icon="database">
    Agents remember context across conversations. Build chatbots that recall previous interactions and learn from feedback.
    
    **Example:** Customer support bot that knows ticket history.
  </Accordion>

## Who Uses Splox?

**AI Engineers**  
Build production multi-agent systems without infrastructure headaches. Focus on agent design, not DevOps.

**Developers**  
Automate internal tools and workflows faster than building from scratch. Write code when needed, use visual editor for the rest.

**Operations Teams**  
Connect existing tools without waiting for engineering. Automate repetitive tasks in minutes, not weeks.

**Business Teams**  
Automate processes that currently require manual work or jumping between tools.
