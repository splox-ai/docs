## How it Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Build Your Workflow">
    On [app.splox.io](https://app.splox.io), connect agents, tools, and logic nodes visually. Each workflow is a multi-agent system.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Tools & Skills">
    Choose from 10,000+ MCP tools and procedural skills to make your agents domain-specific.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Chat or Trigger">
    Chat with your agent on [chat.splox.io](https://chat.splox.io) or the desktop app, or trigger programmatically via the API.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example: Agent with Tools

  width="100%" 
  height="500px" 
  style={{borderRadius: "8px"}}
  title="Agent with Tools Workflow"
/>

**How it works:**
1. **Start node** initiates the workflow
2. **Agent** processes your request and can call any connected tools
3. **Tool router** dynamically selects the right tool based on the agent's needs
4. **Chat interface** lets you interact with the agent in real-time

For multi-agent workflows, connect multiple agents where each agent handles a specialized task - one agent can call another agent as part of the workflow.

## Why Choose Splox?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Multi-Agent Workflows" icon="brain">
    Build systems where agents collaborate. One agent analyzes, another executes, a third validates - all connected visually.
    
    **Example:** Research agent → Writing agent → Editing agent pipeline.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="10,000+ Tools & Skills" icon="wrench">
    Access MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools and procedural skills. Combine them to create highly specialized, domain-specific agents.
    
    **Example:** Financial analysis agent with market data tools + calculation skills.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Chat Interface Built-In" icon="messages">
    Interact with workflows through a full chat interface. Side panel or full view - test and use your agents conversationally.
    
    **Example:** Chat with your research agent, ask follow-ups, iterate on results.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Visual + Code" icon="code">
    Build workflows visually, add custom logic when needed. No infrastructure to manage.
    
    **Example:** Connect nodes visually, write Python for complex transformations.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Node Types

Build workflows with these building blocks:

- **Start Node** - Define workflow entry points and triggers
- **Agent Node** - Autonomous AI agents with LLM + Tools loops
- **Tool Node** - Execute custom functions or MCP tools
- **Switch Node** - Conditional branching based on data or AI decisions
- **Merge Node** - Combine data from multiple sources
