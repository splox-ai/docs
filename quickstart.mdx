## Step 2: Set Up Your AI Provider

Most templates need an AI provider to work. Choose one option:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Use Splox Services (Fastest)">
    **No API keys needed!** Splox handles everything.
    
    1. Go to Settings in Splox
    2. Select your AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
    3. Leave BYOK disabled (default)
    4. Start building immediately
    
    You'll be charged usage + commission through Splox.
    
    **Recommended for beginners**
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)">
    **Bring your own OpenAI/Anthropic key** for direct billing.
    
    1. Get an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) or [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/)
    2. Go to Settings in Splox
    3. Enable BYOK and enter your API key
    4. Select it in your workflow
    
    **Note:** Splox still charges a small commission for platform features.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
**Which should I choose?**  
- **First time?** → Use Splox Services (default)
- **Have API keys?** → BYOK  
- **Not sure?** → Use Splox Services (you can switch later)
</Info>

## Step 3: Customize Your Workflow

Once you've opened a template, here's what to do:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Explore the Canvas">
    Look at the nodes (boxes) and edges (arrows). Each node is a step in your workflow.
    
    - **Agent Nodes** = AI agents that think, plan, and use tools
    - **Tool Nodes** = Actions like sending emails, querying databases
    - **Switch Nodes** = Conditional logic ("if this, then that")
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click on a Node">
    View and edit its configuration:
    - Change the AI model
    - Adjust the prompt/instructions
    - Modify input variables
    - Add tools
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Individual Nodes">
    Click on any node to open its configuration panel on the right side. Click the **"Run"** button at the bottom to test that node individually and see its output before running the full workflow.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect Your Tools">
    If a template uses Slack, Telegram, or databases, connect them in the Tool Node configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Pro tip:** Hover over any node or edge to see tooltips explaining what it does.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Run Your Workflow

Time to see it in action!

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Manual Trigger">
    **Test your workflow interactively**
    
    The fastest way to test your workflow:
    
    <img className="block dark:hidden" src="https://splox-app.s3.amazonaws.com/019a0c59-309a-70eb-889e-b6b05fa5af27_chat-mode-light.png" alt="Chat Mode Interface" />
    <img className="hidden dark:block" src="https://splox-app.s3.amazonaws.com/019a0c59-3098-70eb-9df5-0511cd844503_chat-mode-dark.png" alt="Chat Mode Interface" />
    
    1. Click the **Chat icon** (speech bubble) in the toolbar
    2. Select your **Start node** from the dropdown
    3. Start typing and chatting with your workflow
    4. See responses in real-time as nodes execute
    
    **Best for:** Testing, debugging, and interactive conversations
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Webhook Trigger">
    **Call your workflow from anywhere**
    
    1. Copy the webhook URL from your workflow settings
    2. Send a POST request with your data:
       ```bash
       curl -X POST https://app.splox.io/api/v1/webhooks/{webhook_id} \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{"event": "user.signup", "email": "user@example.com"}'
       ```
    3. Get back a `workflow_request_id` to track execution
    4. View results in Executions tab
    
    **Best for:** Production automations, external integrations
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 5: Monitor & Debug

Keep an eye on your workflow executions:

<img className="block dark:hidden" src="https://splox-app.s3.amazonaws.com/019a0c59-30ae-70eb-821c-7582b15fe9b9_debug-panel-light.png" alt="Debug Panel" />
<img className="hidden dark:block" src="https://splox-app.s3.amazonaws.com/019a0c59-30ac-70eb-9dc2-6ef9733a2fa7_debug-panel-dark.png" alt="Debug Panel" />

**Debug Panel** - Shows real-time execution status:
- View all nodes in your workflow
- See which nodes are running, completed, or blocked
- Monitor execution time and status
- Click any node to inspect its input/output

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Execution History" icon="clock">
    View all past runs, see which nodes succeeded/failed, and inspect outputs.
    
    **Location:** Workflow → Executions tab
  </Card>

  <Card title="Real-Time Monitoring" icon="terminal">
    Watch your workflow run in real-time. The Debug Panel shows node-by-node progress with status indicators (Running, Completed, Blocked).
    
    **Location:** Debug Panel (sidebar during execution)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Error Handling" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    If a node fails, the workflow stops. Click the failed node to see the error message.
    
    **Fix:** Update configuration and re-run
  </Card>

  <Card title="Node Outputs" icon="file-export">
    Every node stores its output. Reference it in later nodes using `{{ node_id.output }}` syntax.
    
    **Example:** `{{ llm_1.content }}`
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
