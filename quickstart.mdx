## Step 1: Start with the Template

<Card 
  title="AI Agent Starter" 
  icon="wand-magic-sparkles"
  href="https://app.splox.io/templates/019b36e4-f41b-7d9f-9b4d-fb87d550f21f">
  **Your first multi-agent workflow**
  
  A simple agent connected to tools - ready to customize and extend.
  
  **Includes:**
  - Voice and text interaction
  - Tool integration examples
  - Pre-configured AI model
  
  **Time:** 2 minutes to first chat
</Card>

<Info>
**Using Desktop App?** Your first workflow is automatically set up - just login and start chatting!
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Template">
    Click the card above to open the starter template in Splox
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explore the Workflow">
    See the visual graph: Start → Agent → Tools. Each node is a step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="No configuration needed">
    The template works out of the box. Customize later as you learn.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: AI Provider (Optional)

The starter template uses Splox's default AI provider - no setup needed. You can switch to your own API keys later.

<Accordion title="Want to use your own API keys? (BYOK)" icon="key">
  **Bring your own OpenAI or Anthropic key** for direct billing.
  
  1. Get an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) or [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/)
  2. Go to Settings in Splox
  3. Enable BYOK and enter your API key
  4. Select it in your workflow's agent node
  
  **For now:** Skip this and use the default provider to get started faster.
</Accordion>

## Step 3: Understand the Workflow

The starter template shows you the basics:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Node">
    Entry point of your workflow. Defines what triggers it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Agent Node">
    The AI that processes requests. Can use multiple tools and reason through complex tasks.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Tool Nodes">
    Actions the agent can take - API calls, data processing, integrations with 10,000+ tools.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Edges (Arrows)">
    Connect nodes to define data flow. Tool edges let agents dynamically choose which tools to use.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Click any node** to see its configuration. You can edit prompts, change models, and add more tools.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Chat with Your Workflow

Interact with your agent via voice or text:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Web Chat (In Browser)">
    **Chat directly in the web app**

    ```
    
    **Best for:** Production automations, external integrations

## Step 5: Monitor & Debug

Keep an eye on your workflow executions:

<img src="https://splox-app.s3.amazonaws.com/019ba343-aef6-7f4a-936d-6d7a5669c925.png" alt="Debug Panel" style={{borderRadius: "8px"}} />

**Debug Panel** - Shows real-time execution status:
- View all nodes in your workflow
- See which nodes are running, completed, or blocked
- Monitor execution time and status
- Click any node to inspect its input/output

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Execution History" icon="clock">
    View all past runs, see which nodes succeeded/failed, and inspect outputs.
    
    **Location:** Workflow → Executions tab
  </Card>

  <Card title="Real-Time Monitoring" icon="terminal">
    Watch your workflow run in real-time. The Debug Panel shows node-by-node progress with status indicators (Running, Completed, Blocked).
    
    **Location:** Debug Panel (sidebar during execution)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Error Handling" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    If a node fails, the workflow stops. Click the failed node to see the error message.
    
    **Fix:** Update configuration and re-run
  </Card>

  <Card title="Node Outputs" icon="file-export">
    Every node stores its output. Reference it in later nodes using `{{ node_id.output }}` syntax.
    
    **Example:** `{{ llm_1.content }}`
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
