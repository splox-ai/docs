title: 'Get Workflow Request'
openapi: 'GET /workflow-requests/{id}'
---

Retrieves the status and results of a workflow execution triggered by webhook.

## Usage

Use the `workflow_request_id` returned from the webhook trigger to poll for execution status and results.

## Polling

For long-running workflows, poll this endpoint to check if execution is complete:

```bash
# Check status every few seconds
GET /v1/workflow-requests/{workflow_request_id}
```

## Status Values

- `pending` - Request received, waiting to start
- `in_progress` - Currently executing
- `waiting` - Paused, waiting for user input or external event
- `completed` - Finished successfully
- `failed` - Execution failed (check output field for error details)
- `stopped` - Execution was manually stopped

## Output Data

When `status` is `completed`, the `output` field contains the workflow results.

When `status` is `failed`, the `output` field may contain error information.
