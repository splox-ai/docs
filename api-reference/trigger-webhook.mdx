title: 'Trigger Workflow via Event Webhook'
openapi: 'POST /events/{webhook_id}'
---

Sends an event to a workflow via its Event Hub webhook URL.

## Usage

Event webhooks allow external services (Telegram, Slack, Stripe, GitHub, etc.) to trigger workflow execution:

```
POST https://app.splox.io/api/v1/events/{webhook_id}
```

## Authentication

Webhooks can optionally validate a secret header:
- **No secret**: Any request is accepted
- **Secret validation**: Requires the correct value in the `X-Webhook-Secret` header

## Payload

Send any JSON payload — it will be stored as an event and routed to subscribed agents. The raw payload becomes the Start node's output, accessible via variable mappings like `{{ start.field_name }}`.

**Payload limit:** 10MB

## Verification Challenges

The endpoint automatically handles verification challenges from:
- **Slack** — responds to `url_verification` type with the challenge token
- **Facebook/Instagram** — responds to `hub.mode=subscribe` GET requests with `hub.challenge`

## Response

Returns the event ID:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "event_id": "uuid-of-the-stored-event"
}
```
