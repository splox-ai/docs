title: 'Listen to Chat Events (SSE)'
openapi: 'GET /chat-internal-messages/{chatId}/listen'
---

Streams real-time events for a chat session via Server-Sent Events (SSE). This is the recommended way to receive live updates when running a workflow through a chat.

## Usage

```bash
curl -N -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://app.splox.io/api/v1/chat-internal-messages/{chat_id}/listen
```

## How It Works

1. Subscribes to the chat's Redis PubSub channel
2. Streams workflow request status updates and node execution events
3. Sends keepalive messages every 3 seconds
4. Checks workflow status every 5 seconds
5. Connection times out after 30 minutes

## Response Format

Standard SSE format. Events contain workflow request and node execution updates:

```
data: {"workflow_request":{"id":"...","status":"in_progress",...},"node_execution":{"id":"...","status":"completed",...}}

data: keepalive

data: {"is_active":false,"type":"workflow_status"}
```

## Event Types

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Workflow + Node update | Contains `workflow_request` and/or `node_execution` fields with current status and data |
| Keepalive | Literal string `keepalive` sent every 3 seconds |
| Workflow status | `{"is_active":false,"type":"workflow_status"}` when a workflow stops |

## Notes

<Info>
**Authentication required:** Users can only listen to their own chats.
</Info>

<Warning>
**Connection timeout:** SSE connections timeout after 30 minutes. Reconnect if needed.
</Warning>

<Tip>
The keepalive messages every 3 seconds prevent connection drops from proxies and load balancers.
