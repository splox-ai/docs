title: 'Listen to Workflow Execution (SSE)'
openapi: 'GET /workflow-requests/{id}/listen'
---

Streams real-time execution updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE) as the workflow runs.

## Usage

This endpoint provides a persistent connection that streams execution events as they happen:

```bash
curl -N -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://app.splox.io/api/v1/workflow-requests/{workflow_request_id}/listen
```

## Response Format

Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream with each event containing:

```json
{
  "workflow_request": {
    "id": "0199f123-d60e-7ffd-9131-4cc5ab040ee8",
    "status": "in_progress",
    "workflow_version_id": "0199e001-a23b-7c8d-1234-567890abcdef"
  },
  "node_execution": {
    "id": "0199f124-e70f-8gge-2242-5dd6bc151ff9",
    "node_id": "0199e002-b34c-8d9e-2345-678901bcdef0",
    "status": "completed",
    "output": { "result": "success" }
  }
}
```
