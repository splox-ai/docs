title: 'Listen to Workflow Execution (SSE)'
openapi: 'GET /workflow-requests/{id}/listen'
---

Streams real-time execution updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE) as the workflow runs.

## Usage

```bash
curl -N -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://app.splox.io/api/v1/workflow-requests/{workflow_request_id}/listen
```

## How It Works

1. On connection, all existing node executions are sent immediately
2. Then the stream subscribes to real-time updates via Redis PubSub
3. Each event contains a `workflow_request` and/or `node_execution` update
4. Keepalive messages (`data: keepalive`) are sent every 3 seconds
5. The stream closes when the workflow completes, fails, or stops

## Response Format

Standard SSE format — each event is a `data:` line followed by two newlines:

```
data: {"workflow_request":{...},"node_execution":{...}}

data: keepalive

data: {"workflow_request":{"id":"...","status":"completed",...}}
```

Each event payload contains:

```json
{
  "workflow_request": {
    "id": "0199f123-d60e-7ffd-9131-4cc5ab040ee8",
    "status": "in_progress",
    "workflow_version_id": "0199e001-a23b-7c8d-1234-567890abcdef"
  },
  "node_execution": {
    "id": "0199f124-e70f-8gge-2242-5dd6bc151ff9",
    "node_id": "0199e002-b34c-8d9e-2345-678901bcdef0",
    "status": "completed",
    "output_data": { "text": "Here is the result..." }
  }
}
```

## Status Values

**Workflow Request:**
- `pending` — Request received, waiting to start
- `in_progress` — Currently executing
- `waiting` — Paused, waiting for input (e.g., tool approval)
- `completed` — Finished successfully
- `failed` — Execution failed
- `stopped` — Manually stopped

**Node Execution:**
- `pending` — Queued
- `in_progress` — Currently executing
- `completed` — Finished successfully
- `failed` — Execution failed
- `blocked` — Waiting for dependencies
- `skipped` — Skipped (conditional branch not taken)
- `stopped` — Manually stopped
- `waiting` — Paused, waiting for input
