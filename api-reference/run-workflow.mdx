title: 'Run Workflow'
openapi: 'POST /workflow-requests/run'
---

Triggers a workflow execution. This is the primary way to run workflows programmatically.

## Usage

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.splox.io/api/v1/workflow-requests/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "workflow_version_id": "your-workflow-version-id",
    "chat_id": "your-chat-id",
    "start_node_id": "your-start-node-id",
    "query": "Your message or instruction",
    "files": []
  }'
```

## How It Works

1. The API creates a `WorkflowRequest` with status `pending`
2. The request is enqueued for processing
3. Execution begins at the specified Start node
4. The Start node receives a payload: `{ "text": "<query>", "chat_id": "<chat_id>", "files": [...] }`
5. Downstream nodes access this via `{{ start.text }}`, `{{ start.chat_id }}`, etc.

## Prerequisites

Before running a workflow, you need:

1. **A workflow version ID** — Get it via [List Workflows](/api-reference/list-workflows) or [Get Latest Version](/api-reference/get-workflow-version)
2. **A start node ID** — Get it via [Get Start Nodes](/api-reference/get-start-nodes)
3. **A chat session** — Create one via [Create Chat](/api-reference/create-chat)

## Response

Returns a `workflow_request_id` you can use to:
- **Stream results in real-time:** [Listen to Execution (SSE)](/api-reference/listen-workflow-execution)
- **Get the full execution tree:** [Get Execution Tree](/api-reference/get-execution-tree)
- **View execution history:** [Get History](/api-reference/get-workflow-history)

## Rate Limit

**20 workflow executions per minute** per user.

## Notes

<Info>
**Authentication required:** The authenticated user must own the workflow or have access via a published agent.
