## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://app.splox.io/api/v1
```

## Official SDKs

Use our official SDKs instead of raw HTTP requests:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Python
pip install splox
```

```bash Node.js
npm install splox
```

```bash Go
go get github.com/splox-ai/go-sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

See the full [SDK documentation](/sdks) for quickstart examples, authentication, error handling, and more.

## Authentication

Protected endpoints require a Bearer token in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

Generate API tokens from your [account settings](https://app.splox.io/account?tab=settings).

<Info>
  API tokens require a minimum $2.00 account balance to create. Tokens can be configured with custom expiry (default: 1 hour, max: 1 year).

## Endpoints

The Splox API provides these endpoints:

### Workflows

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/workflows` | List all workflows |
| GET | `/workflows/{id}` | Get a workflow with nodes and edges |
| GET | `/workflows/{id}/versions/latest` | Get the latest workflow version |
| GET | `/workflows/{id}/versions` | List all workflow versions |
| GET | `/workflows/{id}/start-nodes` | Get start nodes for a version |

### Workflow Execution

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/workflow-requests/run` | Run a workflow |
| GET | `/workflow-requests/{id}/listen` | Stream execution updates (SSE) |
| GET | `/workflow-requests/{id}/execution-tree` | Get complete execution hierarchy |
| GET | `/workflow-requests/{id}/history` | Get past executions |
| POST | `/workflow-requests/{id}/stop` | Stop a running workflow |

### Chats

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/chats` | Create a new chat session |
| GET | `/chats/{resourceType}/{resourceId}` | List chats for a resource |
| GET | `/chats/{id}` | Get a chat session |
| DELETE | `/chats/{id}` | Delete a chat session |
| GET | `/chat-history/{chatId}/paginated` | Get paginated message history |
| DELETE | `/chat-history/{chatId}` | Delete all message history |
| GET | `/chat-internal-messages/{chatId}/listen` | Stream chat events (SSE) |

### Events

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/events/{webhook_id}` | Receive external event via webhook |

### Billing

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/billing/balance` | Get current account balance |
| GET | `/billing/transactions` | Get paginated transaction history |
| GET | `/activity/stats` | Get aggregate activity statistics |
| GET | `/activity/daily` | Get daily spending and usage data |

## Typical API Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Discover Your Workflow">
    `GET /workflows` — List your workflows (or search by name). Then get the latest version with `GET /workflows/{id}/versions/latest` and its start node with `GET /workflows/{versionId}/start-nodes`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Chat">
    `POST /chats` — Create a chat session for the workflow. The chat ID is used for context memory and SSE streaming.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run the Workflow">
    `POST /workflow-requests/run` — Trigger the workflow with your query, chat ID, workflow version ID, and start node ID. Returns a `workflow_request_id`.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Listen for Results">
    `GET /workflow-requests/{id}/listen` — Connect to the SSE stream to receive real-time execution updates as nodes complete.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Response Format

All responses return JSON. Example run workflow response:

```json
{
  "workflow_request_id": "0199f123-d60e-7ffd-9131-4cc5ab040ee8"
}
```

Use this ID to listen for results, get the execution tree, or check history.

## SSE Streaming

SSE endpoints (`/listen`) use standard Server-Sent Events format:

```
data: {"workflow_request": {...}, "node_execution": {...}}

data: keepalive
```

- Keepalive messages sent every **3 seconds**
- Connection timeout: **30 minutes** (reconnect if needed)

## Rate Limits

| Endpoint | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| `POST /workflow-requests/run` | 20 per minute per user |
